        Thank you for scheduling a time to chat! Please add your name and phone
        number in the subject line manually under (your name here) and (your
        number here).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, please send over an updated resume and the names of any
        people you know at Google (either socially or professionally) that would
        be very helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, our chat is NOT an interview or technical conversation. My
        goal is to learn more about you and your experience to see how we can
        find a good fit here at Google.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please also note that I may call you a few minutes past the scheduled
        call time and that I have a hard stop time at the thirty minute mark.
        Also, please choose an appointment slot at least one hour prior so I
        know it's on my calendar in case I'm in a meeting beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please provide me with the following information before our phone call.
